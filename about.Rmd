# Experience
<hr>
Having completed a Bachelor's degree in Psychology I have gained some valuable skills needed for my future career in research. Furthermore I have spent time working as a lab assistant abroad in Germany at Humboldt University of Berlin where I had hands-on experience on conducting experiments using EEG. Currently I am using single-pulse TMS techniques along with EOG to measure eye movement data.
