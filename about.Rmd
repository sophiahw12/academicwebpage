# About Me
<hr>
I am a postgraduate student undertaking 'Research Methods of Psychological Science' at the University of Glasgow's
[Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/).
I work with [Dr. Domenica Veniero](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/domenicaveniero/) and [Prof. Gregor Thut](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/gregorthut/).

# Master's Project
<hr>
A visual percept called ’phosphene’, a flash or flicker of light in the visual field, can be
elicited by activation of the visual cortex. In this project, visual cortex excitability will be tested by assessing
the rate at which participants perceive phosphenes. To test the effect of rapid eye movements
called saccades (to the left/right) on phosphene perception rates, blindfolded participants will
make horizontal saccades followed by single-pulse occipital transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS). The aim of this experiment is to investigate the activation of the early visual
cortex through saccadic eye movements.

# Education
<hr>
* Sep 2017 - Current, M.Sc. Research Methods of Psychological Science, University of Glasgow
* Sep 2012 - Jun 2016, M.A. Psychology, University of Glasgow

# Experience
<hr>
Having completed a Bachelor's degree in Psychology I have gained some valuable skills needed for my future career in research. Furthermore I have spent time working as a lab assistant abroad in Germany at Humboldt University of Berlin where I had hands-on experience on conducting experiments using EEG. Currently I am using single-pulse TMS techniques along with EOG to measure eye movement data.
